# üîÅ Loops in C++

## üéØ Aim

To implement basic C++ programs using **loops** for control flow. These programs demonstrate printing patterns, number series, and repeated outputs using different loop types such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.

## üìö Theory

Loops in C++ are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. They help reduce redundancy and improve the efficiency of code. There are three primary types of loops:

- `for` loop: Ideal when the number of iterations is known.
- `while` loop: Used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.
- `do-while` loop: Similar to `while`, but guarantees at least one execution.

These programs strengthen the foundational understanding of loop control structures and are often asked in basic programming interviews or exams.

## üßÆ Algorithms / Steps

### 1. **Print even values between 0 to 10**
- Start a `for` loop from 0 to 10.
- Use `if (i % 2 == 0)` to check for even.
- Print the value.

### 2. **Print "SIT" 5 times**
- Use a `for` loop from 1 to 5.
- Print `"SIT"` in each iteration.

### 3. **Simple Pyramid Star Pattern**
- Use nested `for` loops.
- Outer loop for rows.
- Inner loops for spaces and stars.

### 4. **Flipped Pyramid Star Pattern**
- Outer loop for rows.
- Inner loops for leading spaces and stars in decreasing order.

### 5. **Hourglass Star Pattern**
- Two main parts:
  - Inverted pyramid (top)
  - Regular pyramid (bottom)

### 6. **Floyd's Number Triangle**
- Initialize a counter variable.
- Use nested loops to increment and print numbers in triangle form.

### 7. **Floyd's Alphabet Triangle**
- Use nested loops.
- Maintain a character counter using `char ch = 'A'`.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This set of programs helps in understanding how loops function in real-world logic building. Whether printing patterns or sequences, loops are essential for writing clean, efficient, and repeatable code.
